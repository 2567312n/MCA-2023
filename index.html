<h1>MCA 2023</h1>
<h2>Week 1</h2>

<p>Challenges found within music related data would include the differneces between audio recordings and the score, therefore metadata may vary due to differing musicians as well as interpretations of the score.
These challenges are evident in my chosen piece 'Goldberg Variations BWV988 Aria' by J.S Bach. However, due to the compositions dating, I use the Glenn Gould recording which already deviates from the original metadata. Gould performs the piece mathematically to better show Bach's composition style, however this still will ultimatley most likley differ from Bachs original intent. This intent is lost to time; all interpreation of the score is speculative.</p>

<h2>Week 2</h2>

<p>The next stage of analysis that followed was importing the scores PDF into MuseScore to better understand each section of the music and provide insight into how software, such as MuseScore, develops a PDF into musical data that can altered and further understood by way of musicxml and mei files. Importing PDF's into MuseScore, on a base level, is effective. However ,the quality of the import vastly differs between scores. Any score with a cover page, or reference text above/below the manuscript is commonly an issue when attempting to achieve any sort of competent recreation  Using the aforementioned Goldberg Variation Aria PDF (a digitally recreated score), MuseScore effectively recognised basic details such as Key, Time Signature and Tempo as well as most of the notes such as strong beat notes with the correct rhythms. MuseScore struggled with many quicker notes, starting at 1/16th notes as well as ornament’s such as a recurring issue with mordents which could change the character of the piece without their inclusion. The area which required most development was the way the music was structured and how the original was presented. The original uses a piano stave with multiple crossing voices and MuseScore struggled to recognise a second/third voice in the bass clef frequently. The second voice was more common due to the third being mostly underutilised throughout the piece, confusing the software with uneven note rhythm when compared with the time signature. This fault mainly resides with the original's structuring and the import done well to keep the correct time signature regardless. Overall, it was a competent import with minor changes needed (at least when compared with alternate pieces which I used as a test, as they where completely unrecognisable or had an incomplete import due to their complexity).

<h2>Week 3</h2>

<p>I exported the score into a musicxml file and then opened this in Mei-Friend (then downloading the code as an mei file to include into the GitHub repository data folder). Within MEI, pitch is represented by 'pname=x' ('x' being the note name) and 'oct=x' ('x 'being that notes numerical octave positioning) Rhythm/Duration is detailed by 'dur=x' ('x' being the numerical name for the given note (i.e. dur=8 is a quaver/eighth note)). An MEI file displays all data contained within the score. This information being listed in its entirety removes the user-friendly interface found within software such as MuseScore. This makes it more difficult to operate when composing music. However, MEI allows the user to see and edit every aspect of the file and with basic understanding of the code; allows the user to learn exactly what every note’s pitch and numerical rhythm duration/ octave placement without having to understand how the music is notated on the stave.</p>

<h2>Week 4</h2>

<p>Using Music21 - Jupyter Notebook, I was able to develop various alternative visualistions of the Goldberg Variations score. The core data accoumulated stemmed from a Histogram, Piano Roll of pitches and a Scatter Plot graph.
The Histogram informs on the frequency of pitches in their octave placement, helping to display the harmonic heights and depths the piece primarily resides within.
The Piano Roll of Pitches similarly displays notes. However, this graph focuses less on the octave placement but the individual pitches (regardless of octave) in their prescribed measures.
The Scatter Plot allows us to see the duration of these notes to better understand their prominance within the piece.
These all assit in understanding the harmony of the Goldberg Variations Aria. Futhermore, the key becomes visualised as well as Bach's 'leaning' on certain intervals within the key.</p>

<h2>Week 5</h2>

<p>Incorporating added metadata into the schema allows for the score to present needed information about the piece. 
Dictating what is necessary information for the listener presents a need for understanding the demographic. 
Between the Group Lab and Individual Lab there was a clear difference between necessary information for audio recordings of the piece compared to score metadata.
Audio recordings require the composer AND the performer(s) names, instruments as well as recording length, period of release and copyright information on that recording.
Score data is similar yet requires less performance indictation. Recording length is less important due to the option for orchastred changes such as tempo and therefore changes of tempo throughout the piece indicated by the player,orchastrator. 
Key is already present within the score.
The performer(s) are not needed in the metadata of the score as the period of release of the score (the classical genre being of significance also) as since the release there have been thousands of changes to the performer since being composed by Bach.
Therefore Johann Sebastian Bach is of utmost significance to the score information being the composer and original performer of the piece while the following performers are of little importance other than the audio recordings.
Instrumention is still important to the score. Usually being prescrivbed as Piano. However, it being an Aria, the instrumentation is still up to the performers choice.
It is also important to note who the score was encoded by. Due to the score being scanned in from pdf into mscv there was changes to be made to the score because of complications in exportation. Therefore, the person that corrected these changes has to be noted as responsible.

<h2>Week 8</h2>

<p>Time-frequency analysis provides more useful analytical data than waveform analysis. A waveform displays the amplitude against time, showing the bigger moments by way of waves that deviate further from the centre. Time-frequency visualisations such as the Spectrogram used display frequency against time as a heat map; the denser areas of the spectrogram show the bigger moments in the piece. This is more effective as we can see where these bigger moments on the frequency range. The denser areas show if the piece is generally lower or if it builds to a high frequency at these bigger moments. Although we can’t extract exact pitches from the spectrogram we get a general overview of the pieces frequency range, whether it be lower/higher, and how it changes over time.</p>
