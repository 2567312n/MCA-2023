Using Music21 - Jupyter Notebook, I was able to develop various alternative visualistions of the Goldberg Variations score. The core data accoumulated stemmed from a Histogram, Piano Roll of pitches and a Scatter Plot graph.
The Histogram informs on the frequency of pitches in their octave placement, helping to display the harmonic heights and depths the piece primarily resides within.
The Piano Roll of Pitches similarly displays notes. However, this graph focuses less on the octave placement but the individual pitches (regardless of octave) in their prescribed measures.
The Scatter Plot allows us to see the duration of these notes to better understand their prominance within the piece.
These all assit in understanding the harmony of the Goldberg Variations Aria. Futhermore, the key becomes visualised as well as Bach's 'leaning' on certain intervals within the key.
