## Week 1 Goldberg Variations
/[ Challenges found within music related data would include the differneces between audio recordings and the score, therefore metadata may vary due to differing musicians as well as interpretations of the score\] 
/[ These challenges are evident in my chosen piece 'Goldberg Variations BWV988 Aria' by J.S Bach. However, due to the compositions dating, I use the Glenn Gould recording which already deviates from the original metadata. Gould performs the piece mathematically to better show Bach's composition style, however this still will ultimatley most likley differ from Bachs original intent. This intent is lost to time; all interpreation of the score is speculative/]
