Within MEI, pitch is represented by 'pname=x' ('x' being the note name) and 'oct=x' ('x 'being that notes numerical octave positioning)
Rhythm/Duration is detailed by 'dur=x' ('x' being the numerical name for the given note (i.e. dur=8 is a quaver/eighth note))
An MEI file displays all data contained within the score.
This information being listed in its entirety removes the user-friendly interface found within software such as MuseScore. This makes it more difficult to operate when composing music. However, MEI allows the user to see and edit every aspect of the file and with basic understanding of the code; allows the user to learn exactly what every notes exact pitch and numerical rhythm duration/ octave placement without having to understand how the music is notated on the staff.
