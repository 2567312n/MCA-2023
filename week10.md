Using a WAV file generated from the MIDI file of the Goldberg Variations score I created a Polyphonic Transcription of said WAV file to see how accurate the transcription is compared to scanning in the pdf from week 2. This export to MIDI from WAV is widly different from the original score. While getting some notes correctly, the time signature, key signature, tempo and most of the rhytms as well as notes are incorrect. It reflects the test pdf's I imported into MuseScore in week 2. Those tests were of scanned in manuscript while the one I used for Bach's piece was arranged in similar software to MuseScore. The manuscript usually had inconsistent lighting and hand written markings which MuseScore struggled with and displayed the same issues as the Polyphonic Transcription from WAV. This shows the WAV file is read as unclear and possibly the left hand melody moving with the right hand bass confuses musescore as extra beats in the bar and notes with unclear pitches leading the software to assume too much of the score.
