[Week two Goldberg](week2.md)
### Week 2
Importing PDF's into musescore on a base level is effective however the quality of the import vastly differs between scores. Any score with a cover page, or refernce text above/below the manuscript is commonely an issue with and sort of result.
Using the Goldberg Variation Aria; a digitally recreation, Musescore effectively recognised the base level details such as Key, Time Signature and Tempo as well as MOST of the notes such as storng beat notes with the correct rhythms. Musecore struggled with many quicker notes, starting at 1/16th notes as well as ornamnets such as a recurring issue with mordents which could change the character of the piece without. The area which required most development was the way the music was structured and how the original presneted the Aria. The original uses a piano stave with multiple crossing voices and MuseScore struggled to recognise a second/third voice in the bass clef frequently. The second voice was more common due to the third being mostly underutlised, confusing the software with uneven note rhythm to the time signature. This fault mainly resides with the original's structuring and the Import done well by keeping the correct time signature regardless. Overall, it was a compotent import with minor changes, at least compared with differing pieces used as a test which where completely unrecognisable or having an incomplete import due to their complexity
