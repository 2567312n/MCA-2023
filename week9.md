After using Jupyter Notebook to retrieve Historgrams of my 3 tracks Chromagrams, I noticed very slight differance between them. While Olafsson and Lang Lang appear to be almost exactly the same, Gould's varies but only very slightly. Gould performs with a more striking force to the keys as well as added grace notes that the other 2 choose not to include though generally the 3 are very similar. The extra notes answer for the slight deviation though as i hinted, the similarity between the songs is evident from the Histograms alone and one would be able to come to the conclusion they were covers of the same score.
