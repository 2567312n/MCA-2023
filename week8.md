Time-frequency analysis provides more useful analytical data than waveform analysis. A waveform displays the amplitude against time, showing the bigger moments by way of waves that deviate further from the centre. Time-frequency visualisations such as the Spectrogram used display frequency against time as a heat map; the denser areas of the spectrogram show the bigger moments in the piece. This is more effective as we can see where these bigger moments on the frequency range. The denser areas show if the piece is generally lower or if it builds to a high frequency at these bigger moments. Although we canâ€™t extract exact pitches from the spectrogram we get a general overview of the pieces frequency range, whether it be lower/higher, and how it changes over time.
