Incorporating added metadata into the schema allows for the score to present needed information about the piece. 
Dictating what is necessary information for the listener presents a need for understanding the demographic. 
Between the Group Lab and Individual Lab there was a clear difference between necessary information for audio recordings of the piece compared to score metadata.
Audio recordings require the composer AND the performer(s) names, instruments as well as recording length, period of release and copyright information on that recording.
Score data is similar yet requires less performance indictation. Recording length is less important due to the option for orchastred changes such as tempo and therefore changes of tempo throughout the piece indicated by the player,orchastrator. 
Key is already present within the score.
The performer(s) are not needed in the metadata of the score as the period of release of the score (the classical genre being of significance also) as since the release there have been thousands of changes to the performer since being composed by Bach.
Therefore Johann Sebastian Bach is of utmost significance to the score information being the composer and original performer of the piece while the following performers are of little importance other than the audio recordings.
Instrumention is still important to the score. Usually being prescrivbed as Piano. However, it being an Aria, the instrumentation is still up to the performers choice.
It is also important to note who the score was encoded by. Due to the score being scanned in from pdf into mscv there was changes to be made to the score because of complications in exportation. Therefore, the person that corrected these changes has to be noted as responsible.
